# PlaceScan
Python code for interacting with scan data produced by PALab/place.

# About PlaceScan
The code provided in this repository is designed to provide interaction with laboratory data acquired using PLACE: Python package for Laboratory Automation, Control, and Experimentation (see PALab/place). The PlaceScan Python object is created with the congig.json and scan_data.npy files generated by each PLACE scan. Several modules support the main PlaceScan class and provide routines for plotting, re-orgainising, and arrival time picking, etc.

The modular design of the code, centred around the PlaceScan object, provides a convenient way to construct a workflow from simple scripts which perform individual tasks. These simple "control scripts" are short files which first initialise the PlaceScan object, and then call one or more object methods in a few lines to process or display the data.
